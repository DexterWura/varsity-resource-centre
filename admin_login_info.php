echo "🔐 Admin Login Information\n";
echo "=========================\n\n";

echo "📋 Current Situation:\n";
echo "--------------------\n";
echo "✅ All admin pages have been updated to use the new UserAuth system\n";
echo "✅ Admin login now requires email + password (not username)\n";
echo "✅ Admin users must have 'admin' role in the database\n\n";

echo "🚀 How to Login:\n";
echo "---------------\n";
echo "1. Go to: /admin/login.php\n";
echo "2. Use your EMAIL address (not username)\n";
echo "3. Enter your password\n";
echo "4. Make sure your user has 'admin' role\n\n";

echo "🔧 If you don't have an admin user:\n";
echo "----------------------------------\n";
echo "Option 1: Create a new admin user\n";
echo "  - Run: php create_admin_user.php\n";
echo "  - This will create admin@varsityresource.com with password 'admin123'\n\n";

echo "Option 2: Use existing user account\n";
echo "  - Go to /register.php and create a user account\n";
echo "  - Then assign admin role to that user in the database\n\n";

echo "Option 3: Temporary fallback (old system)\n";
echo "  - The old system has: username='superadmin', password='admin123'\n";
echo "  - But this won't work with the updated admin pages\n\n";

echo "💡 Quick Fix:\n";
echo "------------\n";
echo "1. Run: php create_admin_user.php\n";
echo "2. Login with: admin@varsityresource.com / admin123\n";
echo "3. Change password after login\n\n";

echo "🔍 Check Current Admin Users:\n";
echo "-----------------------------\n";
echo "Run: php check_admin_users.php\n";
echo "(This will show all admin users in the database)\n\n";

echo "⚠️  Important Notes:\n";
echo "------------------\n";
echo "• The system now uses database authentication, not JSON files\n";
echo "• All admin pages require 'admin' role, not just authentication\n";
echo "• Email-based login is more secure than username-based\n";
echo "• Make sure to change default passwords after login\n";
